/// Pins down distance-banded entity ticking (Performance.EntityTicking, enabled by
/// default) with EXACT counts against Atlas's EntitySimulationTicks, the engine's own
/// entity-simulation tick counter. Per the Atlas tick contract, an entity that stays
/// unthrottled for the whole window ticks exactly once per entity-simulation tick, so:
/// - the near dummy (8 blocks from the anchor, well inside the 32-block near band with
///   drift margin) must tick EXACTLY simDelta times;
/// - the far dummy (200 blocks, beyond every band) must tick simDelta /
///   VeryFarTickInterval, that is 1 in 10, within stride phase.
///
/// Anchoring rules, all of them earned: the player is teleported to a fixed position
/// first (the join scatters players around 15 blocks, which once put this very probe's
/// near dummy in the mid band on some runs), geometry derives from the anchor's actual
/// position read after the teleport settles, and the end of the window re-checks the
/// anchor-dummy distance as setup-failure semantics so a drift can never read as a wrong
/// count.
