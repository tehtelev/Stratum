/// Statistical probes for random tick limiting
/// (Performance.SimulationDistance.LimitRandomTicks, enabled by default, radius 96
/// blocks). The staged probe mod supplies a block that turns to granite on every random
/// tick it receives, so coverage becomes countable world state: a platform of probe
/// blocks near the player converts steadily, and a platform 200 blocks out must stay
/// untouched.
///
/// The effective conversion rate stacks many engine factors (random sampling, per-chunk
/// caps, the fork's per-pass chunk cap with rotation and slice striding, and a
/// Calendar.SpeedOfTime scale), so the positive assertion claims CANDIDACY, not a rate:
/// one single conversion proves the column is inside the sampled radius (floor of 1,
/// long converging ceiling). The far-platform assertion is exact zero, which is
/// rate-insensitive: outside the clamped radius the chunk is never a candidate at all
/// (decompiled: candidacy is a pure grid scan of server-loaded chunks around each
/// Playing client's chunk, plus or minus range in all three axes).
